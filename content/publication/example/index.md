abstract: Ketamine is commonly used as an anaesthetic agent and has more
  recently gained attention as an antidepressant. It has been linked to
  increased stimulus‐locked excitability, inhibition of interneurons and
  modulation of intrinsic neuronal oscillations. However, the functional network
  mechanisms are still elusive. A better understanding of these anaesthetic
  network effects may improve upon previous interpretations of seminal studies
  conducted under anaesthesia and have widespread relevance for neuroscience
  with awake and anaesthetized subjects as well as in medicine. Here, we
  investigated the effects of anaesthetic doses of ketamine (15 mg kg−1 h−1i.p.)
  on the network activity after pure‐tone stimulation within the auditory cortex
  of male Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus). We used laminar current
  source density (CSD) analysis and subsequent layer‐specific continuous wavelet
  analysis to investigate spatiotemporal response dynamics on cortical columnar
  processing in awake and ketamine‐anaesthetized animals. We found
  thalamocortical input processing within granular layers III/IV to be
  significantly increased under ketamine. This layer‐dependent gain enhancement
  under ketamine was not due to changes in cross‐trial phase coherence but was
  rather attributed to a broadband increase in magnitude reflecting an increase
  in recurrent excitation. A time–frequency analysis was indicative of a
  prolonged period of stimulus‐induced excitation possibly due to a reduced
  coupling of excitation and inhibition in granular input circuits – in line
  with the common hypothesis of cortical disinhibition via suppression of
  GABAergic interneurons.

  caption: Grand average current-source density profiles A–C, BF and BF −2 in
    awake (A), ketamine (B), and muscimol conditions (C) (n = 9, 11 and 11,
    respectively). Top, best frequency response. Bottom, response 2 octaves
    below the best frequency. The CSD shows the pattern of temporal processing
    (ms) at cortical depths (μm). Representative layer assignment is indicated
    with horizontal dashed lines corresponding to the layers in C. Pure-tone
    stimuli are presented for the first 200 ms. Current sinks (blue) represent
    areas of excitatory synaptic population activity, while current sources
    reflect balancing currents (Happel et al. 2010). D, diagram of the potential
    contribution of cortical recurrent excitation in layers III/IV and its
    presumed balance differences in each of the 3 tested conditions.
