bio: I am just a small-time scientist in a world of chaos. I love basic research as a 
  function of improving our overall understanding of how the brain does it's thing. It 
  feels to me like the 3 most exciting frontiers we have are space, the deep ocean, and 
  the brain. 
  
  In particular, I'm very interested in the mesoscopic scale. That is, populations of 
  neurons and interneurons working collectively to process and respond to the world 
  around us. The balance of excitatory and inhibitory cells in the cortex and their
  individual synaptic variabilities cause the emergence of complex oscillatory behavior 
  and very sophisticated filtering, sorting, categorizing, and so on. I would like to be 
  a part of society's collective processing of those mechanisms.
  
  I advocate in my own circles of influence for discussion of mental health in academia
  —due especially to having Borderline Personality Disorder and having benefited from
  counseling, therapy, and support during diagnosis and up through present-day. I am
  committed to de-platforming and denouncing bigotry, especially in academia.
  
  When I'm not doing research, I play D&D—and even DM, play piano, play video games,
  and play with my pet fancy rats, Pluto and Russel. I also run but since that isn't "play",
  it didn't belong in the sentence before. And I'm a hobby artist, trying to spread my
  love of the brain and it's individual pieces through painting and digitizing neurons.
interests: Research interests include auditory microcircuitry, synaptic variability,
  neuronal oscillations, and population dynamics
